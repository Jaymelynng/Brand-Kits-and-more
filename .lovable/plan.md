## ✅ Remove Contact & Location Section from Gym Profile — COMPLETED

### What changed
Removed the "Contact & Location" card that appeared on the gym profile page. It previously showed an empty "Click Edit to add contact information" message and was not needed.

### What was done

- Deleted the JSX block that rendered the Contact & Location section
- Deleted the `GymContactInfo` component file entirely

This change is complete. No further action needed.
